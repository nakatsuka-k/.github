I operate in layers most people never look at.

Between interfaces and infrastructure.  
Between intention and execution.  
Between what is visible and what simply *works*.

## ⟁ Approach

I do not build features in isolation.  
I design systems as **living structures** —  
where every component has weight,  
and every dependency introduces gravity.
